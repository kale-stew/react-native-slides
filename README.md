# From React to React Native: How Hard Could It Be?

These are the slides from my presentation at [RVA.js](https://www.rvajavascript.com/) in Richmond, Virginia on November 15th, 2019, titled "React to React Native: How Hard Could It Be?".

In this talk, I answer the following questions:

- What is React?
- What is React Native?
- How does React differ from React Native?
- What are some pain points a dev might encounter transitioning a React app to React Native?
- What's in store for the future of React Native development?
